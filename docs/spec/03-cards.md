# Feature: Flashcard Management

## Overview

A **Card** belongs to a Deck and has a `front` (question/term) and `back` (answer/definition). Users can add, edit, and delete cards within a deck.

## Routes

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/decks/[id]/edit` | Edit all cards in a deck |
| `/decks/[id]/ai` | Generate cards via AI |

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/decks/[id]/cards` | None | Add cards (bulk) |
| PUT | `/api/decks/[id]/cards/[cardId]` | None | Update card front/back |
| DELETE | `/api/decks/[id]/cards/[cardId]` | None | Delete a card |

## Data

See [data-models.md](./data-models.md#card) for the full Card model.

**Request body for bulk create:**
```json
{
  "cards": [
    { "front": "string", "back": "string" }
  ]
}
```

**Request body for update:**
```json
{
  "front": "string",
  "back": "string"
}
```

## Notes

- Cards are created in bulk (array) via `POST /api/decks/[id]/cards`
- Creating or updating a card triggers `Deck.updatedAt` to refresh
- Deleting a card cascades to its `StudyResult` records
- Cards can also be generated by AI — see [09-ai.md](./09-ai.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can add one or multiple cards to a deck
- [ ] User can edit card `front` and `back` inline
- [ ] User can delete individual cards
- [ ] Card list in edit view is scrollable and shows all cards
- [ ] Adding cards updates the deck's `updatedAt` timestamp
- [ ] Deleting a card removes its associated study results
